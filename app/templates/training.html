<h2>The Demonstration Phase</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-4 training-text">
        You have a helper robot who will start by demonstrating where several cards belong. Pay attention here because it will give you clues as to the rules for which card goes where!

<h2>The Trial Phase</h2>
<span class="training-text">
